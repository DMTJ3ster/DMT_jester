The places and things I've seen don't resemble even slightly anything I've seen before...</p>

                    <p>The quest for entity contact in DMT experiences is one of the most profound aspects of these journeys. Many explorers spend years searching for that first meaningful encounter, that validation that something more exists beyond our ordinary perception of reality.</p>

                <h3>The Megalithic Structures</h3>
                <p>The mega space ships you describe are a common theme in DMT experiences. These vast, impossible structures seem to exist in a realm where physics as we know it doesn't apply. They represent something beyond our current understanding - perhaps the architecture of consciousness itself.</p>
