He had a jester's hat which only had two bell holders rather than three which is often how they are depicted. White face which had similar characteristics to a Guy Fawkes mask."

                    <p>My reaction was pure joy and excitement. After so many journeys without entity contact, this validation was overwhelming. I told myself over and over hoping I wouldn't forget the details.</p>

                            <p>Classic Harlequin pattern - red and alternating black-white checkered design, a timeless symbol of duality and paradox.</p>

                            <p>Two bells instead of three - a deviation from traditional depictions, suggesting this entity follows its own rules.</p>

                    <p>This encounter represents a breakthrough moment - the transition from seeking to finding, from doubt to validation. The Jester's patient waiting suggests this meeting was as significant for the entity as it was for the explorer.</p>
